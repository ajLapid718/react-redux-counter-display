/*

We will be making an application that displays a number value to the screen;

This is what we will be able to do as a user:

As a user...

1) I can see the most up-to-date number value on the screen;

2) I can click a button to increment the number value by 1;

3) I can click a button to decrement the number value by 1;

4) I can enter any number (amount) to increase the number value by that amount;

5) I can enter any number (amount) to decrease the number value by that amount;
